#Highly skilled migration to Europe in data

### MOTIVATION
Every year, European countries receive thousands of applicants for their Blue Card scheme. The EU Blue Card is a work- and residence permit for highly skilled non-EU/EEA nationals. Our final data science project will take the form of a piece of data-driven journalism. The article will be investigating the profile of migrants. The analysis is based on the
"EU Blue Cards by type of decision, occupation and citizenship" from Eurostat 2021. 

Our aim is to provide the general public with the characteristics of migrants and describe their influx trend within Europe.
