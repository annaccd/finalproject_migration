**The analysis of Eurostat Data "EU Blue Cards by type of decision, occupation and citizenship" from 2021, shows a few important patterns. From 2012 there has been a gradual increase in the number of granted EU Blue Cards. From 2012 till 2019, Germany, France, and Poland were the countries that accepted the most applicants… **


Despite the continuous increase in the number of immigrants to the European Union, results from the Special [Eurobarometer 469](http://www.europeanmigrationlaw.eu/documents/EuroBarometer-IntegrationOfMigrantsintheEU.pdf) show that Europeans know very little about immigration. Around 37% of people said that they are very well informed and only around 4% declared that they are very well informed. Moreover, almost 30% of those surveyed could not estimate the percentage of immigrants from outside of the EU in their countries. On the other extreme, around 17% claimed that the share of immigrants is over ¼ of inhabitants of their countries. Despite little knowledge, people still are entitled to have an opinion on the effects of immigration. In the same survey, around 38% of respondents stated that immigration from outside the EU is more of a problem and only 1/5 believed that immigration is an opportunity. Acknowledging little awareness about the immigration phenomenon, this article aims to fill this knowledge gap and provide insights into high-skilled migration from outside of the EU. The first part brings the readers closer to this issue and secondly attempts to investigate briefly to what extent this High-skilled immigration can be perceived as an opportunity on the example of France. This is particularly important in the light of the recently enacted New Pact on Migration and Asylum to attract more high-skilled migrants to the EU.

> *An EU Blue Card gives highly-qualified workers from outside the EU the right to live and work in an EU country, provided they have higher professional qualifications, such as a university degree, and an employment contract or a binding job offer with a high salary compared to the average in the EU country where the job is.*

According to [Eurostat Data](http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?dataset=migr_resbc1), from 2012 till 2019, EU states received 179 597 applications. The number does not include the UK. Additionally, data for Croatia before accessing the EU are not available. More remarkably data for Cyprus and Greece are missing. Individual numbers are also absent for 2012. Still, the number of people that have applied over these years exceeds the population of Potsdam and is still increasing. Moreover, European Union has decided recently to simplify the process in order to attract more high-skilled workers to Europe. Note, that EU Blue Card does not apply in Denmark and Ireland.

Mentioned data shows, that there is a clear increasing tendency in the granted applications. Below you can compare them, with the numbers of renewed but also withdrawn applications over years. As you can see, the Withdrawn applications also increased, however, in comparison to the successful applications the increase has been modest. There were only around 400 Withdrawn applications until 2019, whereas the granted applications increased by more than 30k.

Nevertheless, the numbers of granted applications differed across the countries. The comparison with Potsdam was not accidental. According to Eurostat data, the majority of the successful applications were recorded in Germany, which over 7 years admitted almost 134 916 applications. In comparison, the second biggest number was noted in France - 7100. The third country with the highest number of successful applications was Poland that admitted 5257 immigrants. This is around 25% of the accepted applications in Germany. The animation below shows the accumulated increase of accepted applications for each top 15 EU states from 2012 till 2019.

Could these high-skilled immigrants be the response to the mismatch of the skills and skills gap at the EU market? Potentially, looking at the qualification of the professionals from the outside of Europe, we can see a few patterns that could be insightful. The stable and consequent increase can be observed among people who declare to have background in science and engineering but also among these who claim to be ICT professionals. These skills are sought-after at the EU market.For example, only in 2019 55% surveyed companies experienced difficulties in recruiting ICT specialists.

> *The share of labour force with high-level qualifications should rise from 31.2% in 2013 to around 38% 
in 2025. People with medium-level qualifications will also increase slightly from 47.3% in 2013 to around 48% 
in 2025. The share of those with low-level qualifications will fall from 21.5% in 2013, to below 14 % by 2025.*
