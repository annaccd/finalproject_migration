**The analysis of Eurostat Data "EU Blue Cards by type of decision, occupation and citizenship" from 2021, shows a few important patterns. From 2012 there has been a gradual increase in numbers of applictions for EU Blue Card. From 2012 till 2019, countries that accepted the most applicats were Germany, France and Poland. (...) **


Despite the continuous increase in the number of migrants to the European Union, results from the Special Eurobarometer 469 show that Europeans know very little about immigration. Around 37% of people said that they are very well informed and only around 4% declared that they are very well informed (XXXX). Moreover, almost 30% of those surveyed could not estimate the percentage of immigrants from outside of the EU in their countries. On the other extreme, around 17% claimed that the share of immigrants is over Â¼ of inhabitants of their countries (XXXX). At the same time, around 38% of respondents think that immigration from outside the EU is more of a problem and only 1/5 believe that immigration is an opportunity. This article aims to fill this knowledge gap and provide insights into high-skilled migration from outside of the EU. Firstly, the article tries to bring the readers closer to this issue and secondly attempts to see to what extent this High-skilled immigration can be perceived as an opportunity in the case of France. This is particularly important in the light of the recently enacted New Pact on Migration and Asylum to attract more high-skilled migrants to the EU.

> *An EU Blue Card gives highly-qualified workers from outside the EU the right to live and work in an EU country, provided they have higher professional qualifications, such as a university degree,and an employment contract or a binding job offer with a high salary compared to the average in the EU country where the job is.*}

According to Eurostat Data (XXXX), from 2012 till 2019, EU states received 179 597 applications. The number does not include the UK. Additionally, data for Croatia before accessing the EU are not available. More remarkably data for Cyprus and Greece are missing. Individual numbers are missing for 2012. Still, the number of people that have applied over these years exceeds the population of Potsdam and is still increasing. European Union has decided recently to simplify the process in order to attract more high-skilled workers to Europe. Note, that EU Blue Card does not apply in Denmark and Ireland.


Mentioned data shows, that there is a clear increasing tendency in the granted applications. Below you can compare them, with the numbers of Renewed but also Withdrawn applications. As you can see, the Withdrawn applications also increased, however, in comparison to the successful applications the result is small. There were only around 400 Withdrawn applications until 2019, whereas the granted applications increased by almost 30k.

Nevertheless, the numbers of granted applications differed accross the countries.The comparison with Potsdam was not accidental. According to data (XXXX), the majority of the successful applications were recorded in Germany, that over 7 years admitted almost 134 916 applications. In comparison the second biggest number was noted in France - 7100. The third country with the highest number of successful applications was Poland that admitted 5257 immigrants which is around 25% of the applications in Germany. The below animations shows the acumulated increase of accepted applications for each top 15 EU states from 2012 till 2019.
